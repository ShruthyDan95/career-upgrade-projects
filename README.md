# QA Learning Journey

Hi, I'm Shruthy. I’m restarting my IT career by taking small, consistent steps every day.  
This repository will track my learning progress in:

- Software Testing (QA)
- SQL
- Playwright Automation
- Business Analysis basics
- Data/BI fundamentals

I’ll be updating this daily/weekly as I learn.
